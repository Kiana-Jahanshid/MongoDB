# MongoDB - ODM 


ORM , was an intermediary between an oop code , and a database . it is for converting our oo codes into a relational sql database's queries and vice versa .

sqlmodel was a solution to this goal .



 + Here , bc we want to use a Non-relational database (MONGODB) , we have to use ODM (Object Document Mappers).

 + In MongoDB , we have collections (like tables in sql) , and DOCUMENTS (like queries in sql) so we call it ODM .
